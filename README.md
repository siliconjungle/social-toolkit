# social-toolkit
An open source, component and utilities library for social features of websites.

## Overview
This toolkit has been designed to make frontend social features as accessible as possible to developers. The features this toolkit covers should range from standard features you'd see in a social media application to social features you'd see in traditionally less social sites.

e.g. Spotify (collaborative lists, favouriting, following people, adding friends, etc.), Pocket (following people to start seeing articles they've saved), Etoro (comments, messages), Marketplaces (comments, messages).

This repository should also include robust examples of different usecases for the components.
